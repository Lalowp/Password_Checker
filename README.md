# Password_Checker
A Python program to check through a .txt file whether the password is okay to use it or it is better to change it. The HASH C1 method is used for this app. 

This program was based in a course project (Complete Python Developer in 2020: Zero to Mastery) by Andrei Neagoie. However, I changed the project to have the password been read within a text file. Remember, if the Python program and the .txt file are in the same directory, in open command there is no need to add the path file. If you see it can be improved, let me know!

You just need:
*Python 3 installed
